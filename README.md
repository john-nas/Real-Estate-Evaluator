## Background

Utilising the available listings of houses available on the real estate market in Melbourne, Victoria this project will attempt to build an evaluator.
This evaluator has predominately used the scikit-learn ML Python library to train the model. The data has been extracted using API's available on 
www.domain.com.au and the clean up of the data was through the Pandas library.

## Methodology

1. [Preprocess the raw data](#Preprocessing)
2. [Tune the models](#Tune-Model-Parameters)
3. [Compare two or more models](#Evaluate-Model-Performance)


### Preprocess the Data

* Preprocess the dataset prior to fitting the model.
* Perform feature selection and remove unnecessary features.
* Separate the data into training and testing data.

### Tune Model Parameters

* Tune and compare at least two different classifiers.

### Compare Models

* Below is a comparison of each model's performance as well as a summary about your findings and any assumptions you can make based on your model.
